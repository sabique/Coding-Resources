## Coding Resources Collection

![Coding Resource Image](./coding-resource.jpeg)

The repository main aim is to provide the learning resources available on the Internet to the new programmer. Being myself a new programmer I have found it difficult to look out for the available resources, analyze them and then finally go through it. No learning is small or big but having the best resources at one place will definitely save time. The repository is mainly aimed for the Full Stack Developers.

All the shared resources are used/planned by me for my [Free Code Camp Certification](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/) program.

## Why this repository?

After I have completed my first Responsive Web Design certification, few people have asked me what are the resources apart from the Free Code Camp which I have referred to. So here is the repo with the list of all resources I have used so far.

## Full Stack Development

The Free Code Camp is one of the best available resources for learning **Full Stack development**. The entire program is free of cost and arranged in a very orderly manner.

The Free Code Camp curriculum is divided into 6 certifications:
-   Responsive Web Design Certification
-   JavaScript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification
-   Front End Libraries Certification
-   Data Visualization Certification
-   APIs And MicroServices Certification
-   Information Security And Quality Assurance Certification

We will go through resources for each certification one by one.
